# Basic Website Using HTML and TailwindCSS

It was just for HTML, CSS practice. It has a single page that can be opened through [this link](https://mujtabafromthedarkside.github.io/StrateGIK/Task1_Frontend/fe1_final.html).

## Notes

- fe1.html was just for testing. It helps visualize each div via different colors. Instead, I suppose it would be a good practice to use a testing flag in javascript to toggle the testing colors.

- Need to improve responsiveness for smaller screens. I suppose fixing height was a bad idea.
