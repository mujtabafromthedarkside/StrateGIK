# Leaderboard Using React + Tailwind
A frontend assignment: When given multiple users' stats, the website **sorts** them and displays their **leaderboard**.

These users are **hard-coded** in `App.jsx` right now. I have made the website **dynamic** so that number of users won't matter. I have tried to keep it **responsive** so it works on all sizes. The site is live [here](https://curious-hotteok-294fc3.netlify.app/).
